							<p>It would be a grave omission to discuss Crimean Tatar without mentioning the history of its 
								native speakers. Scholars agree that the ethnogenesis of the Crimean Tatars took place 
								in the fifteenth century, when the various ethnic groups that had already resided in 
								the Crimean peninsula started merging into one cohesive identity under the political 
								dominance of Islam in the Crimean Khanate (Lazzerini, 1985). It is thus unsurprising 
								that a lot of Arabic words entered the Crimean Tatar language at this time (Memetov, 1993). 
								Then in 1783, the Khanate fell to Russia under Catherine the Great, prompting many 
								Crimean Tatars to flee for the Ottoman Empire and many Slavic settlers to move into Crimea,
								such that by 1917, Crimean Tatars “made up a mere quarter of the population of their 
								historic homeland” (Glyn Williams, 2002).</p>
							<p>When the Soviet Union first rose to power, Crimean Tatars—along with other non-Russian ethnic 
								groups—were mainly tolerated under the korenizatsiya (indigenization) policy of the early 1920s. 
								In the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Crimean ASSR) established in 1921, Crimean 
								Tatar was the primary language of schools, museums, road signs, etc., with many newspapers and 
								journals founded to promote mass literacy (Lazzerini, 1985). All this promotion operated in 
								the constraints of what historian Yuri Slezkine calls “ethnic particularism”: an ethnic group 
								was allowed to solidify and promote their native language and culture as long as these efforts 
								aimed at a deep understanding of Soviet revolutionary ideals. (Slezkine, 1998). 
								Thus, any manifestations of what the USSR perceived as “nationalist deviations” would be stamped down,
								which led to the killings of Crimean Tatar intelligentsia—many of whom communists— that began in 1928 
								and only intensified in the 1930s (Lazzerini, 1985).</p>
							<p>Then World War Two broke out. During the war, Nazi Germany selected Crimean Tatars out of Soviet POWs 
								to fight on their side, driving a wedge between the Slavic and Crimean Tatar inhabitants of Crimea 
								(Glyn Williams, 2002). As collective punishment for collaborating with the Nazis, between May 18 and 
								May 20, 1944, the Soviet secret police (NKVD) deported approximately 250,000 Crimean Tatars—including 
								members of the Communist Party—to faraway Central Asia (see: Lazzerini, 1985; Bezverkha, 2015). Tens 
								of thousands died, and the Crimean ASSR was abolished soon after. When WWII was over, decorated Red 
								Army veterans of Crimean Tatar descent like Cevdet Dermenci, Abdraim Reshidov and Idris Khaybulaev found 
								themselves forced into exile and not allowed to reenter Crimea. Other veterans of mixed descent like 
								Amet-khan Sultan were caught between two worlds: the NKVD classified them as non-Tatars and let their 
								families reside in Crimea, yet they insisted on identifying as Crimean Tatar and even participated in the
								Crimean Tatar civil rights movement of the 1950s (Uehling, 2004).</p>
							<p>In the following decades, Crimean Tatars fought for the rights to return to their homeland. On September 5, 
								1967, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR issued a decree that cancelled the Stalin-era 
								accusations of treason against Crimean Tatars. Twenty-two years later, the Soviet government officially 
								permitted Crimean Tatars to return home, albeit with great hostility from many of the now-predominant Russian 
								settlers, who protested by reevoking the accusations of the past (Uehling, 2004). According to Bezverkha (2015), 
								by the time Crimean Tatars were able to resettle in Crimea, they had suffered significant cultural loss, 
								and the Russian language had gained dominance in their homeland. Nowadays, Crimean Tatar is a language 
								with a combination of Arabic, Russian and Uzbek influences, and in many families, the language is not 
								being passed down to children, thus putting it in severe endangerment.</p>
