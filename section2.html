							<p>Russians and Crimean Tatars speak two mutually unintelligible languages originating from two different families of phonological contrast. The Russian 
								language is of the Slavic family, which boasts a complex syllabic structure and can tolerate four-consonant clusters in both onsets and codas. 
								For example, <i>взгляд</i> [vzglʲad] ‘glance’ has a four-consonant onset [vzglʲ]. In contrast, Crimean Tatar, a member of the Turkic family, 
								allows no more than one consonant in syllabic onsets (Kavitskaya, 2010, pp. 29). As for codas, Crimean Tatar only permits two-consonant 
								clusters if those clusters are of falling sonority, like in <i>qart</i> ‘old man’. In the context of Russian dominance in Crimea, this 
								linguistic difference prompts an inevitable question: did the Crimean Tatar language have to adapt to the massive, violence-driven 
								influx of Russian words with complex clusters, and if so, how?</p>
							<h2>1.	Epenthesis</h3>
							<p>The distribution of sounds in every language is determined by a system of phonological rules known as "phonotactics".
								When these rules are violated, there are multiple ways for the language itself to adapt. 
								For clusters, the most common method is epenthesis, wherein a vowel is added before or within an unlawful consonant 
								cluster to break it up (Hall, 2011). For example, Spanish does not allow /st/ as an onset cluster, so when words 
								like Middle French <i>stupide</i> or Latin <i>status</i> enter Spanish, they become <i>estúpido</i> and <i>estado</i>, 
								with an &lt;e&gt; vowel added to the beginning so that the &lt;s&gt; will go with the &lt;e&gt; as a separate syllable. In another example, 
								Japanese permits no more than one consonant in onset positions, so an English loanword like Christmas is realized as 
								<i>Kurisumasu</i> (クリスマス), with the /kɹ/ cluster at the beginning of “Christmas” broken apart by inserting an &lt;u&gt; vowel.</p>
							<p>In Crimean Tatar, many words that are borrowed from Russian do exhibit epenthesis. The following data set of 
								Crimean Tatar words written in IPA is taken from Kavitskaya (2010):</p>
							<table>
							  <tr>
							    <th>(1)</th>
							    <th>Crimean Tatar</th>
							    <th>Russian</th>
							    <th></th>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>ɯʃqaf</td>
							    <td>ʃkaf</td>
							    <td>‘wardrobe’</td>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>moskova</td>
							    <td>moskva</td>
							    <td>‘Moscow’</td>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>qɯravat</td>
							    <td>krovatʲ</td>
							    <td>‘bed’</td>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>vɯratʃ</td>
							    <td>vratʃ</td>
							    <td>‘doctor’</td>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>pirizident</td>
							    <td>prʲezʲidʲent</td>
							    <td>‘president’</td>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>pirsedatel</td>
							    <td>prʲedsʲedatʲelʲ</td>
							    <td>‘chairman’</td>
							  </tr>
							</table>
							<p>For the Russian word [ʃkaf], Crimean Tatar adds the high vowel [ɯ] before the voiceless postalveolar fricative [ʃ] 
								to make the word [ɯʃqaf], thus allowing it to be projected as the disyllabic [ɯʃ.qaf.] rather than a monosyllable
								with a complex consonant onset. This is exactly the process behind the Spanish <i>estúpido</i> and <i>estado</i> that we have previously discussed. 
								In another instance, the vowel [o] is inserted into the [kv] cluster in the name of the Russian capital, 
								thus turning [moskva] into [moskova] in the same manner that Christmas is turned into <i>Kurisumasu</i> in Japanese. 
								In other words, the data from Table 1 shows that Crimean Tatar possesses the same types of epenthesis that we have seen in other, 
								more extensively studied languages.</p>
							<h2>2.	Cluster simplification</h3>
							<p>Another way for a language to get rid of illicit clusters is via simplification. For example, the phonotactics of native 
								Finnish words do not permit consonant cluster onsets; thus, the language simplified many of the cluster onsets in 
								loanwords into the very last consonant of that cluster. This is how Swedish <i>Franska</i> ‘French’ became Finnish <i>Ranska</i> 
								and Old Russian <i>kristĭ</i> became Finnish <i>risti</i> (Campbell, 2021, pp. 66).</p>
							<p>Our data set for cluster simplification is a list of Soviet-era loanwords noted in a Russian-language paper by Memetov (1993). 
								These words were transcribed phonetically using the Cyrillic script. Based on the sounds that the Cyrillic letters 
								tend to make, we have attempted to re-transcribe the words into IPA as follows:</p>
							<table>
							  <tr>
							    <th>(2)</th>
							    <th>Crimean Tatar</th>
							    <th>Russian</th>
							    <th></th>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>облас [obləs]</td>
							    <td>область [obɫəsʲtʲ]</td>
							    <td>‘oblast’</td>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>част [t͡ɕæst]</td>
							    <td>счастье [ɕːæsʲtʲje]</td>
							    <td>‘happiness’</td>
							  </tr>
							</table>
							<p>In Table 2, the Crimean Tatar form [obləs] lacks the palatalized [tʲ] of the original Russian word, suggesting that [tʲ] 
								has been deleted when the coda [sʲtʲ] enters Crimean Tatar. (Note that [sʲ] has also been unpalatalized.) As for [t͡ɕæst] 
								‘happiness’, it is difficult to tell whether the loanword has undergone cluster simplification or that it has merely 
								deleted the <i>-ье</i> [je] sequence, which is a Russian nominalizing suffix. The reason for this doubt is because Memetov
								(1993) also mentioned shortened loanwords like <i>прогрессив</i> ‘progressive’ (from Russian <i>прогрессивный</i> ‘progressive’) 
								and <i>колониалъ</i> ‘colonial’ (from Russian <i>колониальный</i> ‘colonial’), both of which lost the adjective suffix <i>-ный</i> 
								of Russian but could still function as adjectives in Crimean Tatar. While this removal of morphological infixes 
								is an intriguing topic to consider in discussions of language contact, it is not relevant to our phonological analysis 
								and will be dismissed. Our conclusion for this section is that there is just one loanword in the data set that provides 
								a clear example of cluster simplification.</p>
							<h2>3.	No change</h3>
							<p>In some cases, loanwords that violate the phonotactics of the recipient language remain the same. For example, we have 
								previously discussed that native Finnish words do not allow cluster onsets. However, due to close contact with 
								English and Swedish, many words with initial clusters have entered Finnish without getting the cluster onsets 
								modified, such as <i>presidentti</i> ‘president’ and <i>krokotiili</i> ‘crocodile’ (Campbell, 2021, pg. 67). This phenomenon 
								was also noted in Crimean Tatar by Kavitskaya (2010):</p>
							<table>
							  <tr>
							    <th>(3)</th>
							    <th>Crimean Tatar</th>
							    <th>Russian</th>
							    <th></th>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>gramota</td>
							    <td>gramota</td>
							    <td>‘reading and writing’</td>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>drama</td>
							    <td>drama</td>
							    <td>‘drama’</td>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>klassifikatsija</td>
							    <td>klassifikatsija</td>
							    <td>‘classification’</td>
							  </tr>

							</table>
							<p>Note that the word прогрессив ‘progressive’ in Memetov (1993) shows this phenomenon too, as its <i>пр</i> 
								[pr] onset is still retained. Regardless, the words listed by Kavitskaya (2010) were characterized by the author 
								as “recent but nonetheless assimilated,” presumably assimilated into widespread use while remaining unassimilated 
								into the phonology. It is unclear how recently the words were borrowed, but in his study of Crimean Tatar, 
								Memetov (1993) also recorded Russian words that were borrowed during the Soviet period and remained unchanged 
								in Crimean Tatar. We thus assume that these unchanged loanwords were also borrowed during the Soviet period, 
								either at the same time as the words in the previous data sets or after them.</p>
