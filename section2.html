							<h2>1.	Epenthesis</h3>
							<p>Around our linguistically diverse world, there exist a number of ways in which a language can adapt to violations of its intrinsic phonological 
								rules—better known as its “phonotactics”. For consonant clusters, the most common way is epenthesis, wherein a vowel is added before or 
								within an unlawful consonant cluster to break it up (Hall, 2011). For example, Spanish does not accept /st/ as a syllable-initial cluster, 
								so when words like the Middle French “stupide” or the Latin “status” enter Spanish, they become “estúpido” and “estado”, with an additional 
								“e” vowel added to the beginning so that the “s” will go with the “e” as a separate syllable. In another example, Japanese permits 
								no more than one consonant in syllable-initial positions, so an English borrowing like “Christmas” is realized as “Kurisumasu” 
								(クリスマス), with the /kɹ/ cluster at the beginning of “Christmas” broken apart by inserting an “u” vowel. </p>
							<p>In Crimean Tatar, many words that are borrowed from Russian do exhibit epenthesis. The following data set of Crimean Tatar words 
								written in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is taken from Kavitskaya (2010):</p>
							<table>
							  <tr>
							    <th>(1)</th>
							    <th>Crimean Tatar</th>
							    <th>Russian</th>
							    <th></th>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>ɯʃqaf</td>
							    <td>ʃkaf</td>
							    <td>‘wardrobe’</td>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>moskova</td>
							    <td>moskva</td>
							    <td>‘Moscow’</td>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>qɯravat</td>
							    <td>krovatʲ</td>
							    <td>‘bed’</td>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>vɯratʃ</td>
							    <td>vratʃ</td>
							    <td>‘doctor’</td>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>pirizident</td>
							    <td>prʲezʲidʲent</td>
							    <td>‘president’</td>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>pirsedatel</td>
							    <td>prʲedsʲedatʲelʲ</td>
							    <td>‘chairman’</td>
							  </tr>
							</table>
							<p>As we can see, for the Russian word [ʃkaf], Crimean Tatar adds the high vowel [ɯ] before the voiceless postalveolar fricative [ʃ] to make the word [ɯʃqaf], 
								thus allowing it to be projected as the disyllabic [ɯʃ.qaf.] rather than a monosyllable with a complex consonant onset. This is exactly 
								the process behind the Spanish “estúpido” and “estado” that we have previously discussed. In another instance, the vowel [o] 
								is inserted into the [kv] cluster in the name of the Russian capital, thus turning [moskva] into [moskova] in the same manner 
								that “Christmas” is turned into “Kurisumasu” in Japanese. In other words, the data from Table 1 shows that Crimean Tatar possesses 
								the same types of epenthesis that we have seen in other, more extensively studied languages.</p>
							<h2>2.	Cluster simplification</h3>
							<p>Another way in which a language can get rid of consonant clusters is by simplification. This process can take place when a word 
								from one language is borrowed into another, but it can also occur as one language develops over time. An example most familiar 
								to English readers would be the /kn/ and /gn/ clusters, which existed in both Old English and Middle English. 
								According to Kökeritz (1945), as English entered the eighteenth century, both sounds began to be simplified to a single nasal 
								consonant /n/. This simplification, however, does not occur at the more conservative orthographic level, so pairs like “knight”-
								“night” retain their spelling from the previous linguistic era although they have grown to sound the same.</p>
							<p>For the phenomenon of cluster simplification, we turn to another source. The following data set comprises Crimean Tatar words that were 
								transcribed phonetically using the Cyrillic script by Memetov (1993). Based on the sounds that the Cyrillic letters tend to make, 
								we have attempted to re-transcribed the words into IPA as follows:</p>
							<p>Some evidence for Crimean Tatar cluster simplification can be found with [obləs] in Table 2. It is clear that the Crimean Tatar form 
								lacks the palatalized sound [tʲ] of the original, which suggests that [tʲ] has been deleted when the word-final consonant cluster 
								[sʲtʲ] enters Crimean Tatar. (Note that the [sʲ] sound has also been unpalatalized.) However, to make a broader statement on cluster
								simplification as a phenomenon in all of Crimean Tatar, one word is far too insufficient, and more data must be gathered.</p>
