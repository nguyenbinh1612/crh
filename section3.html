							<p>Having demonstrated the ways in which Crimean Tatar reckons with Russian consonant clusters, we now seek to examine whether or not 
								these observed phenomena are driven by any phonological rules. Due to the scarcity of data regarding cluster simplification, 
								we will only be focusing on epenthesis.</p>
							<p>According to Uffmann (2013), there are three possible strategies to determine which vowels are involved in the epenthesis of 
								loanwords. The first is default insertion, where a default vowel—usually an [i] or a schwa—gets inserted to break up most 
								consonant clusters, regardless of what different phonetic qualities those clusters may possess. The second is consonantal 
								assimilation, where the epenthetic vowel shares features with the consonant cluster that it is meant to break up. Lastly, 
								there is vowel harmony, in which the epenthetic vowel shares features not with a consonant, but with a vowel already present 
								in the word.</p>
							<p>Let us turn back to our Crimean Tatar data sets. It is clear from Table 1 that there is no default epenthetic vowel, which leaves 
								us with only the possibility of either vowel harmony or consonantal assimilation. But as research on Crimean Tatar and other 
								members of the Turkic language family has shown, vowel harmony appears to be a prevalent phenomenon in this family (see 
								Johanson, 1998; Kavitskaya, 2014; Henry, 2018 for further discussions). Therefore, we will prioritize analyzing the vowels 
								for signs of harmony. We begin by making the following table to catalogue the features of the epenthetic vowels in the previous 
								data sets, as well as the vowels in their vicinity:</p>
							<table>
							  <tr>
							    <th>(3)</th>
							    <th>Crimean Tatar</th>
							    <th>Epenthetic vowel</th>
							    <th>Precedent vowel</th>
							    <th>Subsequent vowel</th>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>ɯʃqaf</td>
							    <td>ɯ [+high, +back, -round]</td>
							    <td>N/A</td>
							    <td>a [-high, +back, -round]</td>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>moskova</td>
							    <td>o [-high, +back, +round]</td>
							    <td>o [-high, +back, +round]</td>
							    <td>a [-high, +back, -round]</td>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>qɯravat</td>
							    <td>ɯ [+high, +back, -round]</td>
							    <td>N/A</td>
							    <td>a [-high, +back, -round]</td>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>vɯratʃ</td>
							    <td>ɯ [+high, +back, -round]</td>
							    <td>N/A</td>
							    <td>a [-high, +back, -round]</td>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>pirizident</td>
							    <td>i [+high, -back, -round]</td>
							    <td>N/A</td>
							    <td>i [+high, -back, -round]</td>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>pirsedatel</td>
							    <td>i [+high, -back, -round]</td>
							    <td>N/A</td>
							    <td>e [-high, -back, -round]</td>
							  </tr>
							</table>
							<p>It is clear from Table 3 that with the exception of [o], all the epenthetic vowels are consistently high, and that they also correspond 
								in backness and roundedness with the subsequent vowels. This is sufficient evidence for regressive epenthetic-driven vowel harmony, 
								which is triggered by the backness and roundedness of the vowel that is successive to the cluster in which epenthesis happens. 
								In simpler terms, in Russian borrowings of Crimean Tatar, when faced with an illicit consonant cluster, Crimean Tatar breaks up 
								said cluster by taking the backness and roundedness of the closest vowel to the right, then adding a high vowel with corresponding 
								parameters into the illicit cluster.</p>
							<p>The mid vowel [o] in [moskova] seems to be the only inexplicable case thus far, because the cluster where epenthesis happens is not 
								an onset. Compared to the two vowels around it, [o] only agrees in backness with the subsequent [a] but not roundedness, so 
								the result is far too inconclusive to be put together with more clearer examples of regressive epenthesis-driven vowel harmony 
								like [ɯʃqaf]. On the other hand, the epenthetic [o] is an exact match with the precedent vowel [o] and is thus too insufficient 
								to hint at any phonological rule. To understand this odd case better, we would have to obtain more data.</p>
