							<p>The cluster-breaking mechanisms that we see in Russian loanwords of Crimean Tatar are consistent with previous analyses. Kavitskaya (2010) 
								observed that Crimean Tatar words exhibit simplification when a cluster is of non-falling sonority, but only as a “postlexical process”. 
								For example, the Crimean Tatar word for ‘friend’ only surfaces as [dos] while its lexical form is still /dost/. 
								A comparison to the loanword for ‘oblast’ is inevitable: does ‘oblast’ only surface as [obləs] while its lexical form 
								remains /obləst/ too? With our lack of data, there is no way to answer this question conclusively. Still, it is an idea 
								that can lead to interesting implications about the lexical form of phonologically illicit loanwords in a recipient language.</p>
							<p>With regards to regressive epenthesis-driven vowel harmony, comparisons can be drawn to other Turkic languages. For example, in some rare 
								cases, Turkish exhibits regressive epenthesis-driven vowel harmony to break up onset consonant clusters of foreign loanwords. 
								The following table analyzes some English loanwords in Turkish that were discussed by Kabak (2011):</p>
							<table>
							  <tr>
							    <th>(5)</th>
							    <th>Turkish</th>
							    <th>Epenthetic vowel</th>
							    <th>Trigger vowel</th>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>sɯtar 'star'</td>
							    <td>ɯ [+high, +back, -round]</td>
							    <td>a [-high, +back, -round]</td>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>pirens 'prince'</td>
							    <td>i [+high, -back, -round]</td>
							    <td>e [-high, -back, -round]</td>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td></td>
							    <td>siteril 'sterile'</td>
							    <td>i [+high, -back, -round]</td>
							    <td>e [-high, -back, -round]</td>
							  </tr>
							</table>
							<p>We see from Table 5 that for Turkish, each of the vowels in the pre-epenthetic loanwords triggers the exact same epenthetic vowel 
								as it does in Crimean Tatar. To illustrate, [e] triggers epenthetic [i] and leads to [siteril] in the Turkish data set of 
								Table 5, and [pirsedatel] in the Crimean Tatar data set of Table 4. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that [e] does not always 
								trigger epenthetic [i] in Turkish: according to Kabak (2011), the epenthetic vowel only corresponds in backness and roundedness 
								with the trigger vowel if the first consonant in the illicit onset cluster is non-velar. If the first consonant in that onset 
								cluster is a velar like /k/ or /g/, the epenthetic vowel will be back even if the trigger vowel is front (e.g. [kɯrem] ‘cream’). 
								Since none of our relevant Crimean Tatar data sets contain velar consonants in such positions, we cannot tell for sure whether 
								Crimean Tatar makes exceptions in relation to velar consonants like Turkish.</p>
							<p>From our analysis of the Crimean Tatar language, we find that it deals with Russian clusters in at least three ways: 
								epenthesis, simplification and no change. For epenthesis, we also find that it is regulated by regressive vowel harmony, 
								such that the epenthetic high vowel matches the trigger vowel in backness and roundedness. The word [moskova] is the 
								only exception, but our data set is too small to allow for any further inquiry into that one case. As for simplification, 
								there is but one instance in the data sets, far too insufficient to lead to any conclusions.</p>
							<p>Moving forward from the analysis, our suggestion is to collect more data of Crimean Tatar. This will allow us to undertake more 
								thorough research inquiries on cluster simplification, as well as delve further into the more complicated aspects of vowel 
								epenthesis that this paper has not been able to analyze for lack of data. But more importantly, given the twentieth-century 
								violence against Crimean Tatars and the specter of the Russo-Ukrainian war, we urge that researchers of linguistics and 
								Eastern European studies alike assist the Crimean Tatars in the preservation of their native language, in order to bring it 
								out of its severely endangered status as of today.</p>
