							<p>From our analysis of the little data on Crimean Tatar to which we have access, we find that the language deals with Russian consonant clusters 
								in at least two ways: epenthesis and simplification. The data for epenthesis is sufficient enough for us to notice that not only does 
								epenthesis exist, but it is also regulated by regressive vowel harmony, wherein the epenthetic high vowel matches the trigger vowel 
								in terms of backness and roundedness. There is one exception to this rule in the loanword [moskova], but our currently available corpus 
								does not allow for any further investigation of this. With regards to simplification, there is but one instance of it in the corpus, 
								which is insufficient to lead to any conclusions.</p>
							<p>In a broader context, the phenomena that we see in Crimean Tatar are consistent with previous analyses of the Turkic language family. 
								For example, not only does Turkish exhibit progressive vowel harmony in its inflectional suffixes, but in some rare cases, it 
								also exhibits regressive epenthesis-driven vowel harmony to break up onset consonant clusters of foreign loanwords (Kabak, 2011). 
								Based on the analysis of Kabak (2011), the epenthetic vowel will also correspond in backness and roundedness with the trigger vowel 
								if the first consonant in the onset cluster is non-velar (e.g. [sɯtar] ‘star’, [pirens] ‘prince’, [siteril] ‘sterile’). If the 
								first consonant in the onset cluster is a velar like /k/ or /g/, the epenthetic vowel will be back even if the trigger vowel is 
								front (e.g. [gɯlikoz] ‘glucose’, [kɯrem] ‘cream’). Because none of our relevant data sets contain velar consonants in such onset 
								positions, it is not yet clear whether Crimean Tatar makes exceptions in relation to velar consonants like Turkish.</p>
							<p>Moving forward from the analysis, our suggestion is to collect more data of the Crimean Tatar language. This will allow us to 
								undertake more thorough research inquiries on cluster simplification, as well as delve further into the more complicated 
								aspects of vowel epenthesis that this paper has not been able to analyze for lack of data. But more importantly, given the 
								twentieth-century violence against Crimean Tatars and the specter of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, we urge that researchers 
								of linguistics and Eastern European studies alike should aid the Crimean Tatars in the preservation of their native language, 
								in order to bring it out of its severely endangered status as of today.</p>
