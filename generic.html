							<h2>I.	WHO ARE THE CRIMEAN TATARS? </h2>
							<p>It would be a grave omission to discuss Crimean Tatar without mentioning the history of its native speakers. 
								Scholars agree that the ethnogenesis of the Crimean Tatars took place in the fifteenth century, when the various ethnic groups that 
								had already resided in the Crimean peninsula started merging into one cohesive identity under the political dominance of Islam in 
								the Crimean Khanate (Lazzerini, 1985). It is thus unsurprising that a lot of Arabic words entered the Crimean Tatar language at this time 
								(Memetov, 1993). Then in 1783, the Khanate fell to Russia under Catherine the Great, prompting many Crimean Tatars to flee for the 
								Ottoman Empire and many Slavic settlers to move into Crimea, such that by 1917, Crimean Tatars “made up a mere quarter of the 
								population of their historic homeland” (Glyn Williams, 2002).</p>
							<p>When the Soviet Union first rose to power, Crimean Tatars—along with other non-Russian ethnic groups—were mainly 
								tolerated under the korenizatsiya (indigenization) policy of the early 1920s. In the Crimean Autonomous 
								Soviet Socialist Republic (Crimean ASSR) established in 1921, Crimean Tatar was the primary language of 
								schools, museums, road signs, etc., with many newspapers and journals founded to promote mass literacy 
								(Lazzerini, 1985). All this promotion operated in the constraints of what historian Yuri Slezkine calls 
								“ethnic particularism”: an ethnic group was allowed to solidify and promote their native language and 
								culture as long as these efforts aimed at a deep understanding of Soviet revolutionary ideals. (Slezkine, 1998). 
								Thus, any manifestations of what the USSR perceived as “nationalist deviations” would be stamped down, 
								which led to the killings of Crimean Tatar intelligentsia—many of whom communists— that began in 1928 
								and only intensified in the 1930s (Lazzerini, 1985).</p>
							<p>Then World War Two broke out. During the war, Nazi Germany selected Crimean Tatars out of Soviet POWs to fight on 
								their side, driving a wedge between the Slavic and Crimean Tatar inhabitants of Crimea (Glyn Williams, 2002). 
								As collective punishment for collaborating with the Nazis, between May 18 and May 20, 1944, the Soviet secret 
								police (NKVD) deported approximately 250,000 Crimean Tatars—including members of the Communist Party and the 
								Red Army—to faraway Central Asia (see: Lazzerini, 1985; Bezverkha, 2015). Tens of thousands died, and the 
								Crimean ASSR was put to an end after the deportation. According to Bezverkha (2015), by the time Crimean Tatars 
								were able to return to Crimea in the late 1980s, they had suffered significant cultural loss, and the Russian language had gained dominance 
								in their homeland. Nowadays, Crimean Tatar is a language with a combination of Arabic, 
								Russian and Uzbek influences, and in many families, the language is not being passed down to children, thus putting it 
								in severe endangerment.</p>
