							<h2>I.	WHO ARE THE CRIMEAN TATARS? </h2>
							<p>It would be a grave omission to discuss Crimean Tatar without mentioning the history of its native speakers. 
								Scholars agree that the ethnogenesis of the Crimean Tatars took place in the fifteenth century, when the various ethnic groups that 
								had already resided in the Crimean peninsula started merging into one cohesive identity under the political dominance of Islam in 
								the Crimean Khanate (Lazzerini, 1985). It is thus unsurprising that a lot of Arabic words entered the Crimean Tatar language at this time 
								(Memetov, 1993). Then in 1783, the Khanate fell to Russia under Catherine the Great, prompting many Crimean Tatars to flee for the 
								Ottoman Empire and many Slavic settlers to move into Crimea, such that by 1917, Crimean Tatars “made up a mere quarter of the 
								population of their historic homeland” (Glyn Williams, 2002).</p>
							<p>When the Soviet Union first rose to power, Crimean Tatars—along with other non-Russian ethnic groups—were mainly 
								tolerated under the korenizatsiya (indigenization) policy of the early 1920s. In the Crimean Autonomous 
								Soviet Socialist Republic (Crimean ASSR) established in 1921, Crimean Tatar was the primary language of 
								schools, museums, road signs, etc., with many newspapers and journals founded to promote mass literacy 
								(Lazzerini, 1985). All this promotion operated in the constraints of what historian Yuri Slezkine calls 
								“ethnic particularism”: an ethnic group was allowed to solidify and promote their native language and 
								culture as long as these efforts aimed at a deep understanding of Soviet revolutionary ideals. (Slezkine, 1998). 
								Thus, any manifestations of what the USSR perceived as “nationalist deviations” would be stamped down, 
								which led to the killings of Crimean Tatar intelligentsia—many of whom communists— that began in 1928 
								and only intensified in the 1930s (Lazzerini, 1985).</p>
							<p>Then World War Two broke out. During the war, Nazi Germany selected Crimean Tatars out of Soviet POWs to fight on 
								their side, driving a wedge between the Slavic and Crimean Tatar inhabitants of Crimea (Glyn Williams, 2002). 
								As collective punishment for collaborating with the Nazis, between May 18 and May 20, 1944, the Soviet secret 
								police (NKVD) deported approximately 250,000 Crimean Tatars—including members of the Communist Party and the 
								Red Army—to faraway Central Asia (see: Lazzerini, 1985; Bezverkha, 2015). Tens of thousands died, and the 
								Crimean ASSR was put to an end after the deportation. According to Bezverkha (2015), by the time Crimean Tatars 
								were able to return to Crimea in the late 1980s, they had suffered significant cultural loss, and the Russian language had gained dominance 
								in their homeland. Nowadays, Crimean Tatar is a language with a combination of Arabic, 
								Russian and Uzbek influences, and in many families, the language is not being passed down to children, thus putting it 
								in severe endangerment.</p>
							<h2>II.	PHONOLOGICAL PROCESSES</h2>
							<h3>1.	Epenthesis</h3>
							<p>Around our linguistically diverse world, there exist a number of ways in which a language can adapt to violations of its intrinsic phonological 
								rules—better known as its “phonotactics”. For consonant clusters, the most common way is epenthesis, wherein a vowel is added before or 
								within an unlawful consonant cluster to break it up (Hall, 2011). For example, Spanish does not accept /st/ as a syllable-initial cluster, 
								so when words like the Middle French “stupide” or the Latin “status” enter Spanish, they become “estúpido” and “estado”, with an additional 
								“e” vowel added to the beginning so that the “s” will go with the “e” as a separate syllable. In another example, Japanese permits 
								no more than one consonant in syllable-initial positions, so an English borrowing like “Christmas” is realized as “Kurisumasu” 
								(クリスマス), with the /kɹ/ cluster at the beginning of “Christmas” broken apart by inserting an “u” vowel. </p>
							<p>In Crimean Tatar, many words that are borrowed from Russian do exhibit epenthesis. The following data set of Crimean Tatar words 
								written in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is taken from Kavitskaya (2010):</p>
							<p>As we can see, for the Russian word [ʃkaf], Crimean Tatar adds the high vowel [ɯ] before the voiceless postalveolar fricative [ʃ] to make the word [ɯʃqaf], 
								thus allowing it to be projected as the disyllabic [ɯʃ.qaf.] rather than a monosyllable with a complex consonant onset. This is exactly 
								the process behind the Spanish “estúpido” and “estado” that we have previously discussed. In another instance, the vowel [o] 
								is inserted into the [kv] cluster in the name of the Russian capital, thus turning [moskva] into [moskova] in the same manner 
								that “Christmas” is turned into “Kurisumasu” in Japanese. In other words, the data from Table 1 shows that Crimean Tatar possesses 
								the same types of epenthesis that we have seen in other, more extensively studied languages.</p>
							<h3>2.	Cluster simplification</h3>
							<p>Another way in which a language can get rid of consonant clusters is by simplification. This process can take place when a word 
								from one language is borrowed into another, but it can also occur as one language develops over time. An example most familiar 
								to English readers would be the /kn/ and /gn/ clusters, which existed in both Old English and Middle English. 
								According to Kökeritz (1945), as English entered the eighteenth century, both sounds began to be simplified to a single nasal 
								consonant /n/. This simplification, however, does not occur at the more conservative orthographic level, so pairs like “knight”-
								“night” retain their spelling from the previous linguistic era although they have grown to sound the same.</p>
							<p>For the phenomenon of cluster simplification, we turn to another source. The following data set comprises Crimean Tatar words that were 
								transcribed phonetically using the Cyrillic script by Memetov (1993). Based on the sounds that the Cyrillic letters tend to make, 
								we have attempted to re-transcribed the words into IPA as follows:</p>
							<p>Some evidence for Crimean Tatar cluster simplification can be found with [obləs] in Table 2. It is clear that the Crimean Tatar form 
								lacks the palatalized sound [tʲ] of the original, which suggests that [tʲ] has been deleted when the word-final consonant cluster 
								[sʲtʲ] enters Crimean Tatar. (Note that the [sʲ] sound has also been unpalatalized.) However, to make a broader statement on cluster
								simplification as a phenomenon in all of Crimean Tatar, one word is far too insufficient, and more data must be gathered.</p>
							<h2>III.	PHONOLOGICAL RULES</h2>
							<p>Having demonstrated the ways in which Crimean Tatar reckons with Russian consonant clusters, we now seek to examine whether or not 
								these observed phenomena are driven by any phonological rules. Due to the scarcity of data regarding cluster simplification, 
								we will only be focusing on epenthesis.</p>
							<p>According to Uffmann (2013), there are three possible strategies to determine which vowels are involved in the epenthesis of 
								loanwords. The first is default insertion, where a default vowel—usually an [i] or a schwa—gets inserted to break up most 
								consonant clusters, regardless of what different phonetic qualities those clusters may possess. The second is consonantal 
								assimilation, where the epenthetic vowel shares features with the consonant cluster that it is meant to break up. Lastly, 
								there is vowel harmony, in which the epenthetic vowel shares features not with a consonant, but with a vowel already present 
								in the word.</p>
							<p>Let us turn back to our Crimean Tatar data sets. It is clear from Table 1 that there is no default epenthetic vowel, which leaves 
								us with only the possibility of either vowel harmony or consonantal assimilation. But as research on Crimean Tatar and other 
								members of the Turkic language family has shown, vowel harmony appears to be a prevalent phenomenon in this family (see 
								Johanson, 1998; Kavitskaya, 2014; Henry, 2018 for further discussions). Therefore, we will prioritize analyzing the vowels 
								for signs of harmony. We begin by making the following table to catalogue the features of the epenthetic vowels in the previous 
								data sets, as well as the vowels in their vicinity:</p>
							<p>It is clear from Table 3 that with the exception of [o], all the epenthetic vowels are consistently high, and that they also correspond 
								in backness and roundedness with the subsequent vowels. This is sufficient evidence for regressive epenthetic-driven vowel harmony, 
								which is triggered by the backness and roundedness of the vowel that is successive to the cluster in which epenthesis happens. 
								In simpler terms, in Russian borrowings of Crimean Tatar, when faced with an illicit consonant cluster, Crimean Tatar breaks up 
								said cluster by taking the backness and roundedness of the closest vowel to the right, then adding a high vowel with corresponding 
								parameters into the illicit cluster.</p>
							<p>The mid vowel [o] in [moskova] seems to be the only inexplicable case thus far, because the cluster where epenthesis happens is not 
								an onset. Compared to the two vowels around it, [o] only agrees in backness with the subsequent [a] but not roundedness, so 
								the result is far too inconclusive to be put together with more clearer examples of regressive epenthesis-driven vowel harmony 
								like [ɯʃqaf]. On the other hand, the epenthetic [o] is an exact match with the precedent vowel [o] and is thus too insufficient 
								to hint at any phonological rule. To understand this odd case better, we would have to obtain more data.</p>
							<h2>IV.	CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION</h2>
							<p>From our analysis of the little data on Crimean Tatar to which we have access, we find that the language deals with Russian consonant clusters 
								in at least two ways: epenthesis and simplification. The data for epenthesis is sufficient enough for us to notice that not only does 
								epenthesis exist, but it is also regulated by regressive vowel harmony, wherein the epenthetic high vowel matches the trigger vowel 
								in terms of backness and roundedness. There is one exception to this rule in the loanword [moskova], but our currently available corpus 
								does not allow for any further investigation of this. With regards to simplification, there is but one instance of it in the corpus, 
								which is insufficient to lead to any conclusions.</p>
							<p>In a broader context, the phenomena that we see in Crimean Tatar are consistent with previous analyses of the Turkic language family. 
								For example, not only does Turkish exhibit progressive vowel harmony in its inflectional suffixes, but in some rare cases, it 
								also exhibits regressive epenthesis-driven vowel harmony to break up onset consonant clusters of foreign loanwords (Kabak, 2011). 
								Based on the analysis of Kabak (2011), the epenthetic vowel will also correspond in backness and roundedness with the trigger vowel 
								if the first consonant in the onset cluster is non-velar (e.g. [sɯtar] ‘star’, [pirens] ‘prince’, [siteril] ‘sterile’). If the 
								first consonant in the onset cluster is a velar like /k/ or /g/, the epenthetic vowel will be back even if the trigger vowel is 
								front (e.g. [gɯlikoz] ‘glucose’, [kɯrem] ‘cream’). Because none of our relevant data sets contain velar consonants in such onset 
								positions, it is not yet clear whether Crimean Tatar makes exceptions in relation to velar consonants like Turkish.</p>
							<p>Moving forward from the analysis, our suggestion is to collect more data of the Crimean Tatar language. This will allow us to 
								undertake more thorough research inquiries on cluster simplification, as well as delve further into the more complicated 
								aspects of vowel epenthesis that this paper has not been able to analyze for lack of data. But more importantly, given the 
								twentieth-century violence against Crimean Tatars and the specter of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, we urge that researchers 
								of linguistics and Eastern European studies alike should aid the Crimean Tatars in the preservation of their native language, 
								in order to bring it out of its severely endangered status as of today.</p>
